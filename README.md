# consumer_complaint_classification

This project contains all the code necessary to reproduce consumer_complaint_classification problem using Python 3 namely Jupyter Notebook.
 
The objective of this project is to classify consumer complaints about financial products and services in the finance industry into a product category that it belongs to. For this we make use of description of the complaint; and since it has multiple categories, this becomes a multi-classification problem which can be solved through many of the machine learning algorithms.

Once the algorithm is set in place we can easily classify new complaints to its category and redirect it to the concerned person. By doing this we manage to save a lot of time by minimizing the human intervention to decide whom this complaint should go to.

In this study we employ an open-source dataset containing more than 500000 consumer complaints from Consumer Financial Protection Bureau found in Kaggle website. The dataset can be found at the following url: https://www.kaggle.com/subhassing/exploring-consumer-complaint-data/data
